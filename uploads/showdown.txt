Song by
Electric Light Orchestra

She cried to the southern wind
'Bout a love that was sure to end
Every dream in her heart was gone
Headin' for a showdown

Bad dreamer, what's your name?
Looks like we're ridin' on the same train
Looks as though there'll be more pain
There's gonna be a showdown (sing, c'mon)

And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

She came to me like a friend
She blew in on a southern wind
Now my heart is turned to stone again
There's gonna be a showdown

Said save me
Oh, save me
It's unreal, the suffering
There's gonna be a showdown (c'mon)

And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

(Rainin', rainin')
(Rainin', rainin')

And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night (c'mon)

And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

Thank you
