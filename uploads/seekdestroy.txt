Song by

Alright!

We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up a fight
There is an evil feeling in our brains
But there's nothing new, you know it drives us insane

Running, on our way, hiding
You will pay dying
One thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding
You will pay dying
One thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been taking and now you're giving

Running, on our way, hiding
You will pay dying
One thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding
You will pay dying
One thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it will not go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away 'cause you're the one we will find

Running, on our way, hiding
You will pay dying
One thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding
You will pay dying
One thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
