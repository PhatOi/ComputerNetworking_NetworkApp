Song by
Olivia Rodrigo

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)

Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying, singing in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends
Saying you're so unique, hm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first, I made the jokes
You tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) hm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, and almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress, I hate to think that
I was just your type

I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singing it together, now I bet you even tell her
How you love her in between the chorus and the verse (ooh)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about, played you the songs
She's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh)
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh)

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're trading jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)

Play her piano (oh), but she doesn't know (oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
(I know you get déjà vu)

I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
