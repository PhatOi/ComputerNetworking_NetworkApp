"supernatural"

Don't want nobody else around me
Just need you right here
You're like the only thing that I see
It's crystal clear, and I

I want you to come claim it, I do
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, want you to name it, I do
Want you to make it yours

It's like supernatural
This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's taking over me
Don't wanna fight the fall

It's like supernatural
This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all

Need your hands all up on my body
Like the moon needs the stars
Nothing else felt this way inside me
Boy, let's go too far

I want you to come claim it, I do
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, want you to name it, I do
Want you to make it yours

It's like supernatural
This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's taking over me
Don't wanna fight the fall

It's like supernatural
(This love's possessing me but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessing me but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all

Yeah

I want you to come claim it, I do
You to come name it, I do

This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's taking over me
Don't wanna fight the fall

It's like supernatural
(This love's possessing me but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessing me but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all
It's like supernatural
