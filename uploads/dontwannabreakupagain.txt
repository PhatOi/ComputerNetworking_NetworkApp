Song by
Ariana Grande

I fall asleep crying
You turn up the TV
You don't wanna hear me
One more sleepless night
Big day in the morning
So, I take my time to self-soothe

I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breaking my heart
To keep breaking yours again
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again

I made it so easy
Spent so much on therapy
With my own co-dependency
But you didn't even try
When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I

I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breaking my heart
To keep breaking yours again
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again

We both know this time
So we say goodbye
Just one kiss goodbye
With tears in our eyes
Hope you won't, won't regret me
Hope you still think fondly
Of our little life

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breaking my heart
To keep breaking yours again
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again

Don't wanna break up again
I don't wanna, baby
Situationship has to end
Know it has to end
I just can't refuse
